# StockAutomation
Using the Yahoo Finance API to display stock information on the Apple stock price and the Invesco NASDAQ100 ETF price
 I displayed 5 sets of informstion:
 Open, High, Low, Close, Adjusted Close, and Volume
 
 I used the climage package to make it easier for the user to see which company's stock he is looking at as the package enables me to display a pixelated image of the company's logo. (I don't know a better way unfortunately)
